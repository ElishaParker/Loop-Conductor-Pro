# üéµ LoopConductor Pro v2

**Advanced Modular Web Audio Rhythm Engine**

[‚ñ∂ **Live Demo ‚Äì Open in Browser**](https://elishaparker.github.io/Loop-Conductor-Pro/)

---

## üöÄ Overview

**LoopConductor Pro v2** is a modular, browser-based rhythm engine and tone generator built entirely on the Web Audio API.
It provides a full A0‚ÄìC8 pitch range, base pitch tuning up to 16 kHz, LFO modulation (pitch, pan, and volume), and a live oscilloscope display that can be customized in color and line thickness.

Ideal for:

* Sound design and waveform study
* Interactive synthesis and code-based music creation
* Frequency visualization, tuning exploration, and educational demos

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture

Built using:

* **JavaScript ES Modules**
* **Web Audio API** (OscillatorNode, GainNode, StereoPannerNode, AnalyserNode)
* **HTML5 Canvas** for oscilloscope visualization
* **Dynamic DOM inputs** for real-time user control

### Audio Flow:

```
Oscillator ‚Üí Gain ‚Üí Panner ‚Üí MasterGain ‚Üí Analyser ‚Üí AudioContext.destination
```

### Visualization Flow:

```
AnalyserNode ‚Üí ByteTimeDomainData ‚Üí Canvas (rendered at ~60 FPS)
```

## üß© Example Usage

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ElishaParker/Loop-Conductor-Pro.git
cd Loop-Conductor-Pro

# Open in your browser
start index.html
```

Then tweak Bars, BPM, and Notes to generate your rhythm patterns.
Adjust the oscilloscope color and line thickness to personalize your visuals.

Would you like me to include a **‚ÄúCredits & Philosophy‚Äù** section at the bottom (something short about our collaborative vision ‚Äî like how LoopConductor bridges code and creativity)? It could close the README with a personal signature tone while keeping it professional.
